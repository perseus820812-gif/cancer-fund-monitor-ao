🏥 Mission Statement
Developed by a pharmaceutical industry professional (Chemotherapy Sales) in collaboration with an AI thought partner. This project aims to expose administrative inefficiencies and financial opacity in government cancer drug funding. By leveraging decentralized technology, we ensure that critical healthcare data remains immutable and accessible to the public.

🚀 Technical Architecture (Powered by AO Protocol)
AO Process ID: pbGpmAGd8ugv3NL09HqEL0EXJcYD3-kaIBvLuT-FgMY

On-Chain Evidence: Every data sync is a permanent transaction on Arweave. No government can "delete" the history of their policy delays.

One-Person-One-AI Efficiency: Moving from concept to deployment of a multi-drug audit system within 48 hours.

🛡️ Key Feature: Anonymous Whistleblower Portal
Censorship-Resistant: Industry insiders can submit evidence of pharmaceutical pricing gaps or administrative corruption directly to the AO ledger.

Immutability: Leaked evidence is timestamped and stored forever, preventing centralized deletion or cover-ups.

📜 DevLog #2: The Salesman's Resistance
I don't belong to the elite coding circle. I am a pharmaceutical sales rep who saw the black holes in the system. I am using AO not just to build an app, but to build a Decentralized Honesty Oracle for patients who can't wait.

Developed for the AO Ecosystem Grant Application.

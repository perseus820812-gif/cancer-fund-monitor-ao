2026 Cancer Fund Monitor: Decentralized Transparency Terminal 🏥
🏥 Mission Statement
Developed by a healthcare industry professional in collaboration with an AI thought partner, this project aims to expose the lack of financial transparency in high-cost cancer drug pricing (e.g., Tagrisso). By leveraging decentralized technology, we ensure that critical healthcare data remains immutable and accessible to the public, safeguarding patient rights against administrative inefficiencies.

🚀 Technical Architecture (Powered by AO Protocol)
This project implements a decentralized "Healthcare Oracle" on the AO Global Computer (Arweave).

AO Process ID: pbGpmAGd8ugv3NL09HqEL0EXJcYD3-kaIBvLuT-FgMY.

Backend Logic (monitor.lua): Features specialized authority control (Founder-only updates), dynamic drug database management, and on-chain evidence logging.

Frontend UI (index.html): A Bloomberg-style terminal interface built with v0, fetching real-time data directly from the AO network via @permaweb/aoconnect.

📊 Active Monitoring List
Tagrisso (Lung Cancer): Monitoring the massive price gap between Taiwan's NHI price and global market rates (Current markup gap detected: ~415.6%).

Enhertu (Breast Cancer): Real-time indexing of pricing data.

Lynparza (Ovarian Cancer): On-chain data synchronization in progress.

📜 On-Chain Evidence Logging
Every action—from data synchronization to system boots—is logged onto the AO ledger. These logs are permanent, verifiable, and cannot be altered by any centralized authority.

## 🏥 Mission Statement / 專案願景
[cite_start]Developed by a **healthcare industry professional** (Chemotherapy Sales) in collaboration with an **AI thought partner**. This project aims to expose administrative inefficiencies and financial opacity in government cancer drug funding. [cite_start]By leveraging decentralized technology, we ensure that critical healthcare data remains immutable and accessible to the public, safeguarding patient rights against administrative silence.

[cite_start]本專案由醫療從業人員與 AI 共同開發，旨在揭露癌症新藥基金的執行效率與預算透明度。利用 AO 去中心化技術，確保關鍵醫療數據不可篡改，對抗行政黑箱並守護病人用藥權益 。

## 🚀 Technical Architecture (Powered by AO Protocol)
- [cite_start]**AO Process ID:** `pbGpmAGd8ugv3NL09HqEL0EXJcYD3-kaIBvLuT-FgMY` 
- **On-Chain Evidence**: Every data sync is a permanent transaction on Arweave. [cite_start]No government can "delete" the history of their policy delays.
- [cite_start]**One-Person-One-AI Efficiency**: Built as a "1 Person + 1 AI" team, moving from concept to a global audit system within 48 hours.

---

## 🛡️ Key Feature: Anonymous Whistleblower Portal
- [cite_start]**Censorship-Resistant**: Industry insiders can submit evidence of pharmaceutical pricing gaps or administrative corruption directly to the AO ledger.
- [cite_start]**Immutability**: Leaked evidence is timestamped and stored forever on the Arweave permaweb, preventing centralized deletion or cover-ups.

## 📊 Real-Time Audit Benchmarks (Global Comparison)
[cite_start]Current monitoring shows a significant gap between life-saving policy and actual drug access:

| Drug Name | Region | Avg. Reimbursement Wait | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enhertu (優赫得)** | Japan | **60 Days** | Fast-Tracked 🟢 |
| **Enhertu (優赫得)** | Taiwan | **458 Days** | Stagnant 🚨 |
| **Koselugo (科舒洛)** | Taiwan | **5+ Months** | ZERO Claims |
| **Trodelvy (拓達維)** | Taiwan | **5+ Months** | ZERO Claims |

[cite_start]*Note: Budget of 5,000,000,000 TWD remains unspent as of 2025-12-30.*

## 🌍 Global Expansion: Beyond Local Monitoring
This project is evolving into a **Global Healthcare Audit Protocol**:
* [cite_start]**Arbitrage Transparency**: We are tracking the **317% - 415% price gaps** of drugs like **Tagrisso** to expose how administrative delays cost lives while budgets remain unspent.
* [cite_start]**Decentralized Truth Oracle**: To build a system that patients worldwide can use to hold their governments accountable.

## 📜 DevLog #2: The Salesman's Resistance
I am a pharmaceutical sales rep. [cite_start]I don't belong to the elite coding circle, but I see the black holes in the system every day. I am using AO not just to build an app, but to build a **Decentralized Honesty Oracle** for patients who can't wait. [cite_start]We don't need to be "kind"; we just need to be **truthful**.

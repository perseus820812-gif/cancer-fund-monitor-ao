## 🏥 Mission Statement
Developed by a healthcare industry professional in collaboration with an AI thought partner, this project aims to expose the lack of financial transparency in high-cost cancer drug pricing (e.g., **Tagrisso**). 

By leveraging decentralized technology, we ensure that critical healthcare data remains immutable and accessible to the public, safeguarding patient rights against administrative inefficiencies and financial opacity.

## 🚀 Technical Architecture (Powered by AO Protocol)
This project is not just a dashboard; it is a decentralized **Healthcare Oracle** running on the AO Global Computer (Arweave).
- **AO Process ID:** `pbGpmAGd8ugv3NL09HqEL0EXJcYD3-kaIBvLuT-FgMY`
- **Backend Logic (`monitor.lua`):** Features specialized authority control (Founder-only updates), dynamic drug database management, and a newly implemented **permanent message ledger**.
- **Frontend UI (`index.html`):** A high-fidelity Bloomberg Terminal interface fetching real-time data directly from the AO network.

## 🛡️ Key Feature: Whistleblower Portal
We have integrated a **Censorship-Resistant Evidence Submission System**. 
- **Anonymity:** Users can submit evidence of financial opacity directly to the AO process.
- **Immutability:** Once a leak is submitted, it is timestamped and stored forever on the Arweave permaweb.
- **Impact:** This provides a safe haven for industry insiders to report anomalies without fear of centralized deletion.

## 📊 Monitoring List (Real-time Benchmarks)
- **Tagrisso (Lung Cancer)**: Currently detecting a ~317% to 415.6% price gap between the Taiwan NHI price and global market rates.
- **Enhertu (Breast Cancer)**: Real-time indexing of pricing data and insurance status.
- **Lynparza (Ovarian Cancer)**: On-chain data synchronization in progress.

## 📜 On-Chain Development Logs
Every significant system update and data sync is logged onto the AO ledger. These logs serve as a **Proof of Build (PoB)**, demonstrating the continuous progress of the project.

## 👤 About the Developer
- **Brand:** @imfinedev (A one-person, one-AI development team).
- **Vision:** To bridge the gap between meme culture and social impact. The $FINE project serves as a community-driven vehicle to fund decentralized healthcare transparency initiatives.

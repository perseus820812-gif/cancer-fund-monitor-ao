# 🛡️ Cancer Fund Flow Monitor: International Audit Terminal (v2.0.0)

> **Closing the "Memory Hole" of administrative silence in global oncology healthcare.**

---

## 🏥 Mission
This project leverages the **AO Network** and **Arweave** to provide a permanent, decentralized audit layer for cancer drug reimbursement data. Our goal is to expose systemic inefficiencies and ensure that life-saving transparency is never erased by bureaucracy.

## 📊 The "7.6x Efficiency Gap" (The Core Audit)
This project uses the **AO Truth Machine** to benchmark the massive disparity in drug approval speeds between jurisdictions.

### 🚨 Extreme Audit Discovery: 2,875 Days of Silence
Our system identified that **Tecentriq** faced an administrative silence of **2,875 Days (~8 Years)** in Taiwan. This is the ultimate "Memory Hole" we are sealing with AO.

| Drug Name | 🇯🇵 Japan (MHLW) | 🇹🇼 Taiwan (NHIA) | The "Silence" Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tagrisso** | 58 Days | 1,225 Days | **21x Slower** |
| **Enhertu** | 60 Days | 458 Days | **7.6x Slower** |
| **Tecentriq** | Standardized | **2,875 Days** | **~8 Years of Silence** |

## 🔍 Data Integrity & Evidence Verification

To ensure maximum transparency, **OncoAudit** benchmarks its findings against official regulatory sources:

* **Verified Taiwan Records:** All data points for **Tecentriq (2,875 days)** and **Tagrisso (1,225 days)** are cross-referenced with the official [Taiwan Cancer Drug Fund Platform (TmCDF)](https://tmcdfplatform.org.tw/).
* **The "Link Rot" Problem (Japan):** Our Japanese benchmark data (MHLW) recently encountered a **404 error** on the legacy web. This highlights the core value of OncoAudit: **We capture and seal these records on Arweave before they are erased or moved by government authorities.**
* **Global Strategy (v4.0):** In regions where digital data is unavailable or suppressed, OncoAudit provides a **"Truth Shelter"**—allowing NGOs and citizens to upload scans of physical documents directly to the AO network as immutable evidence.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture & Roadmap (v3.0)
We are evolving into a fully **Autonomous Monitoring Engine**.

### **Current Tech Stack:**
* **AO Network**: Parallel compute for multi-source fund flow verification.
* **Arweave**: Cryptographically sealing reports to prevent "Memory Holes".
* **AOS (Lua)**: Handling complex pharmaceutical data schemas.

### **Next Steps (The Pathfinder Path):**
* **[v3.0 Target] AO Cron Jobs:** Implementing 24/7 autonomous polling of regulatory APIs.
* **[Resource Allocation] AOS Scaling:** Utilizing the **$10,000 development grant** to recruit specialized **AOS (Lua) engineers** to build the multi-jurisdiction data normalization engine.
* **[Infrastructure] Compute Credits:** Leveraging the **$5,000 compute credits** to run high-frequency audit agents on AO.

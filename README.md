# 🛡️ Cancer Fund Flow Monitor: International Audit Terminal (v2.0.0)

> **Closing the "Memory Hole" of administrative silence in global oncology healthcare.**

---

## 🏥 Mission
This project leverages the **AO Network** and **Arweave** to provide a permanent, decentralized audit layer for cancer drug reimbursement data. Our goal is to expose systemic inefficiencies and ensure that life-saving transparency is never erased by bureaucracy.

## 📊 The "7.6x Efficiency Gap" (The Core Audit)
As an expert in the oncology drug industry, I have identified a critical delay in patient care that often remains hidden. This project uses the **AO Truth Machine** to benchmark these delays.

### 🚨 Extreme Audit Discovery: 2,875 Days of Silence
Our system identified that **Tecentriq** faced an administrative silence of **2,875 Days (~8 Years)** in Taiwan. This is the ultimate "Memory Hole" we are sealing with AO.

| Drug Name | 🇯🇵 Japan (MHLW) | 🇹🇼 Taiwan (NHIA) | The "Silence" Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tagrisso** | 58 Days | 1,225 Days | **21x Slower** |
| **Enhertu** | 60 Days | 458 Days | **7.6x Slower** |
| **Tecentriq** | Standardized | **2,875 Days** | **~8 Years of Silence** |

### 💸 The Financial Impact: "A Financial Death Sentence"
In Taiwan, patients pay approximately **150,000 TWD ($4,600 USD) per month** out-of-pocket during this wait.

* **Keytruda (Colorectal cancer):** Costs a family **7.6 million TWD** in self-pay drugs.
* **Total "Administrative Delay" cost:** Approximately **5,835,000 TWD** per patient.

## 🚀 What's New in v2.0.0 (Technical Migration)
*This update marks the transition from a data model to a decentralized, autonomous audit protocol.*

* **AOS Process Architecture:** Core audit logic has been migrated to **AOS processes** (`OncoAudit.lua` & `monitor.lua`), enabling high-concurrency, cross-border data verification.
* **International Benchmarking:** Integrated Japan’s MHLW data to programmatically calculate the **7.6x efficiency gap**.
* **Proof of Permanence:** Established the protocol to seal government records on Arweave. Currently preparing to archive the **2,875-day Tecentriq records**, pending the **10GB storage endowment** for lifelong integrity.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture & Roadmap (v3.0)
We are evolving into a fully **Autonomous Monitoring Engine**.

### **Current Tech Stack:**
* **AO Network**: Parallel compute for multi-source fund flow verification.
* **Arweave**: Cryptographically sealing reports to prevent "Memory Holes".
* **AOS (Lua)**: Handling complex pharmaceutical data schemas.

### **Next Steps (The Pathfinder Path):**
* **[v3.0 Target] AO Cron Jobs:** Implementing 24/7 autonomous polling of regulatory APIs without human intervention.
* **[Resource Allocation] AOS Scaling:** Utilizing the **$10,000 development grant** to recruit specialized **AOS (Lua) engineers** to build the multi-jurisdiction data normalization engine.
* **[Infrastructure] Compute Credits:** Leveraging the **$5,000 compute credits** to run high-frequency audit agents on AO.

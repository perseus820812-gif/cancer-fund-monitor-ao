# 🛡️ OncoAudit: International Audit Terminal (v2.0.0)

**Closing the "Memory Hole" of administrative silence in global oncology healthcare.**

# 🏥 Mission
This project leverages the **AO Network** and **Arweave** to provide a permanent, decentralized audit layer for cancer drug reimbursement data. Our goal is to expose systemic inefficiencies and ensure that life-saving transparency is never erased by bureaucracy.

# 📊 Global Audit Dashboard (v2.0.0 Expansion)
*Current status of international regulatory administrative lag.*

| Target Drug | Case ID | Baseline (US FDA) | Comparison Region | Status | **Audit Delay** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rituxan** | `RIT-2026-JP` | Oct 2012 | **Japan (MHLW)** | Deliberating | **~13.2 Years** |
| **Xeljanz** | `XEL-2017-EU` | Nov 2012 | **European Union** | Safety Update | **52 Months** |
| **Xeljanz** | `XEL-2013-TW` | Nov 2012 | **Taiwan (TFDA)** | Approved | **13 Months** |

> 🚨 **Audit Discovery:** Rituxan's 100mg/500mg dosage standards were settled by the FDA in 2012. However, our 2026 audit found the MHLW still deliberating partial changes for these same dosages in Japan, exposing a **13.2-year** regulatory gap.

# 🚨 The "7.6x Efficiency Gap" (The Core Audit)
*This project uses the **AO Truth Machine** to benchmark the massive disparity in drug approval speeds.*

## 🚨 Extreme Audit Discovery: 2,875 Days of Silence
Our system identified that **Tecentriq** faced an administrative silence of **2,875 Days (~8 Years)** in Taiwan. This is the ultimate "Memory Hole" we are sealing with AO.

| Drug Name | 🇯🇵 Japan (MHLW) | 🇹🇼 Taiwan (NHIA) | The "Silence" Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tagrisso** | 58 Days | 1,225 Days | **21x Slower** |
| **Enhertu** | 60 Days | 458 Days | **7.6x Slower** |
| **Tecentriq** | Standardized | **2,875 Days** | **~8 Years of Silence** |

# 🔍 Data Integrity & Evidence Verification
To ensure maximum transparency, OncoAudit benchmarks its findings against official regulatory sources. All evidence is anchored via **SHA-256 hashes** to prevent "Link Rot".

* **Verified Taiwan Records:** Cross-referenced with the official [Taiwan Cancer Drug Fund Platform (TmCDF)](https://tmcdfplatform.org.tw/).
* **The "Link Rot" Problem (Japan):** Our Japanese benchmark data (MHLW) recently encountered a 404 error. We have sealed these records on Arweave:
  * **MHLW (Jan 2026):** `106AEB33...`
* **Global Strategy (v4.0):** In regions where digital data is suppressed, OncoAudit provides a **"Truth Shelter"** for NGO document uploads.
  * **US FDA Baseline:** `29D83DF7...`
  * **EU EMA Update:** `2C85A880...`
  * **TW TFDA REMS:** `707C3AC5...`

# 🛠️ Technical Architecture & Roadmap (v3.0)
We are evolving into a fully **Autonomous Monitoring Engine**.

### **Current Tech Stack:**
* **AO Network**: Parallel compute for multi-source fund flow verification.
* **Arweave**: Cryptographically sealing reports to prevent "Memory Holes".
* **AOS (Lua)**: Handling complex pharmaceutical data schemas.

### **Next Steps (The Pathfinder Path):**
* **[v3.0 Target] AO Cron Jobs:** Implementing 24/7 autonomous polling of regulatory APIs.
* **[Resource Allocation] AOS Scaling:** Utilizing the **$10,000 development grant** to recruit specialized **AOS (Lua) engineers**.
* **[Infrastructure] Compute Credits:** Leveraging the **$5,000 compute credits** to run high-frequency audit agents on AO.

# 🛡️ 2026 Cancer Fund Flow Monitor: Accountability on AO
> **"Turning $3B USD Government Promises into Immutable On-Chain Evidence."**

## ⚡ [LATEST AUDIT - 2025-12-30]
* **Stagnant Status Recorded**: We have officially archived the initial execution status of the **100 Billion TWD (~$3B USD)** Cancer New Drug Fund.
* **Audit Discovery**: Current data reveals a **458-day reimbursement lag** in Taiwan compared to **60 days** in Japan for identical oncology treatments.
* **On-Chain Immutability**: All audit logic is live on the AO mainnet; these logs cannot be redacted by centralized authorities.

## 🏥 Mission Statement
Developed by a **healthcare industry professional** (Oncology Sales) in collaboration with an **AI thought partner**. This project aims to expose administrative bottlenecks and financial opacity in government-funded cancer care. By leveraging **AO's decentralized compute**, we ensure that critical patient-access data remains transparent and immune to administrative silence.

## 🚀 Technical Architecture (Powered by AO Protocol)
* **AO Process ID**: `pbGpmAGd8ugv3NL09HqEL0EXJcYD3-kaIBvLuT-FgMY`
* **Permanent Storage**: Audit logs and whistleblower evidence are cryptographically sealed on **Arweave**.
* **Efficiency**: Built as a **"1 Person + 1 AI"** team, moving from conceptualization to a global audit system within 48 hours.

### 🔍 On-Chain Verification
Auditors and developers can verify the truth directly via the `aos` terminal:
```lua
Send({ Target = "pbGpmAGd8ugv3NL09HqEL0EXJcYD3-kaIBvLuT-FgMY", Action = "GetAuditData" })
📊 Real-Time Audit Benchmarks (Global Comparison)
Current monitoring shows a significant gap between life-saving policy and actual drug access:
Drug / Fund,Region,Avg. Reimbursement Wait,Audit Status
Tagrisso / Enhertu,Japan,60 Days,Verified 🟢
Tagrisso / Enhertu,Taiwan,458 Days,Stagnant 🚨
Cancer New Drug Fund,Taiwan,10B TWD Budget,Stagnant 🚨
🛡️ Key Feature: Anonymous Whistleblower Portal
Censorship-Resistant: Industry insiders can submit evidence of pharmaceutical pricing gaps or administrative corruption directly to the AO ledger.

Permanent Integrity: Once evidence is stored on Arweave, it is preserved forever, preventing any centralized cover-ups.

📜 DevLog: The Salesman's Resistance
I am a pharmaceutical sales representative. I don't belong to the traditional elite coding circles, but I witness the systemic "black holes" every day. I am using AO not just to build an application, but to build a Decentralized Honesty Oracle for patients who cannot afford to wait. We don't need to be "kind"; we just need to be truthful.

Developed for the AO Ecosystem Grant Application.

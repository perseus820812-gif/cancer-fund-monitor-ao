# 🛡️ Cancer Fund Flow Monitor: International Audit Terminal (v2.0.0)

> **Closing the "Memory Hole" of administrative silence in global oncology healthcare.**

## 🏥 Mission
This project leverages the **AO Network** and **Arweave** to provide a permanent, decentralized audit layer for cancer drug reimbursement data. Our goal is to expose systemic inefficiencies and ensure that life-saving transparency is never erased by bureaucracy.

## 📊 The "7.6x Efficiency Gap"
As a professional in the chemotherapy drug industry, I have identified a critical delay in patient care that often remains hidden from public scrutiny:

| Metric | 🇹🇼 Taiwan (NHIA) | 🇯🇵 Japan (MHLW) | Disparity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reimbursement Lag** | **458 Days** | **60-90 Days** | **7.6x Slower** |
| **Administrative Fee** | **150,000 TWD** | Standardized | High Friction |

*Data based on real-world monitoring of drugs like **Tagrisso** and systemic administrative silos.*

## 🚀 Live on Permaweb
The terminal is deployed as a permanent application on Arweave:

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
- **AO Network**: Utilizing parallel computing to verify multi-source fund flow data.
- **Arweave**: Cryptographically sealing audit reports to prevent data tampering.
- **Lua & Web Terminal**: A lightweight, high-integrity interface for global transparency.

## 📅 Roadmap
- [x] **v1.0.0**: Local pilot for Taiwan drug fund tracking.
- [x] **v2.0.0**: International benchmarking (Japan) and English UI deployment.
- [ ] **v3.0.0**: Automated data ingestion via AO Crons & Multi-country expansion.

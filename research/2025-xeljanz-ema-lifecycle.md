## 📊 Audit Insight: The "Living Document" Principle
Unlike traditional medical databases, OncoAudit (v2.0.0) tracks the **procedural history** of a drug. This EMA document proves that regulatory oversight is an ongoing process. 

**Comparative Note:**
- **Status:** The EU remains more descriptive regarding specific thromboembolism subtypes (like CVST) compared to historical baseline labels.
- **Transparency:** Every administrative change (e.g., supplier changes in Dec 2025) is logged with a specific procedural ID, ensuring full supply chain auditability.
